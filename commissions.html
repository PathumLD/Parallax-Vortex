            <h2>COMMISSIONS</h2>
           <p>You can commission me to create a realistic, bespoke portrait of your pet. I can work off your own photographs (digital copies work fine) and capture the expressions, that make your pet -- special. All portraits are completed using high quality, lightfast pastels. Pastel brands include Unison, Derwent, Faber Castell and Stabilo, on Clairefontaine Pastelmat or Hahnemuhle Velour paper.  The combination of this material ensures a quality product, which will last for decades.
            I create pet portraits of dogs, cats, horses and birds but I am always happy to undertake any pet. Working from photos allows me to accept commission work from all over UK as well as international customers. As a pet lover and owner myself, I know how much our animals are part of the family and having a portrait of them to treasure especially when they are no longer with us, is very comforting.
            </p>
            <p>I also undertake other animal commissions, so if you have a particular subject in mind, please do contact me and I will do my best to accommodate.</p>
