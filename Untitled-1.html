               <p>"My wife fell in love with this painting after seeing a post on Instagram. I knew I had found the perfect birthday gift for her! I reached out to Nirosh and asked him to reserve it for me. I requested that he frame the painting, which he did within a week. I'm very satisfied with the prompt service and my wife simply adores her gift!"

            <p>"Absolutely brilliant - you managed to portray Kobe's emotions and intricate details so well, it felt as if I was staring at a photograph. 

                I'm a huge fan of your work, and I had no doubts about how great it's going to be. But seeing it for the first time, left me speechless. 
                
                I cannot thank you enough for taking the effort for creating this amazing piece of art. For me, it's priceless. "
